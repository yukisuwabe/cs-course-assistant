Student must fulfill both college and CS major requirement to graduate 

In order to become a CS Major, a student must fullfill all of the following three criteria:

Criterion 1: a grade of C (not C-) in all completed CS, MATH, and CS-approved probability courses.

Criterion 2: a GPA of 2.5 or better in CS 2110/2112* and 2800/2802. ​*alternatively, a GPA of 2.5 or better in ECE 2400/ENGRD 2140 and CS 2800/2802 and CS 3110.

Criterion 3: a GPA of 2.3 or better in Math 1120/1920** and any other completed critical math course(s).
​**if only AP/CASE credit appears, then another critical math course will be needed for the computation (such as MATH 2210, MATH 2940, or a CS-approved probability course).
 

For students that entered Cornell prior to fall 2023 ONLY: Criterion 3 will be reviewed using the better outcome between Criterion 3 (above) and Former Criterion 3 (below).  Note that Criteria 1 and 2 did not change.

Former Criterion 3: a GPA of 2.5 or better in Math 1120/1920**, and CS 2800/2802.
​**if only AP/CASE credit appears, then another critical math course will be needed for the computation (such as MATH 2210, MATH 2940, or a CS-approved probability course).

      -Biological Sciences (BIO-AS)
      -Ethics and the Mind (ETM-AS)
      -Global Citizenship (GLC-AS)

  -Notes: 
    -An A&S course can simultaneously satisfy up to two distribution requirements.
    -Students can double-count distribution requirements on a maximum of two courses (i.e. taking a minimum of eight courses to meet all ten requirements).
    -To fulfill the requirements, courses must contain the suffix -AS. Courses offered outside of the college that are designated without the -AS suffix in the Class Roster will not fulfill A&S requirements.
    -Courses counting toward a major may also count to fulfill distribution requirements.
    -​AP,IB and A-Level credits may not be used to meet distribution requirements.
