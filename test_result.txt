AssertionError: 'CS 4620' not found in "Based on your inferred graduation requirements, I recommend taking CS 5621 Computer Graphics Practicum or CS 5650 Virtual and Augmented Reality. Both courses explore graphics programming and visualization, which align with your technical electives requirement.\n\nFor a more entry-level course, consider CS 1620 Visual Imaging in the Electronic Age, which covers digital pictorial representation and display, including computer graphics modeling and rendering.\n\nIf you're interested in exploring graphics generation using computers, I suggest taking CS 3300 Visual Data Analytics for the Web, which uses Javascript and SVG to develop visualizations."
