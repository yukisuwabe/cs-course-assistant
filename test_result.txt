AssertionError: 'CS 4620' not found in 'Based on the course documents, I recommend taking CS 3300, Visual Data Analytics for the Web, as it explores graphics generation using computers and has a lower level number. It also aligns with the inferred graduation requirements for Technical electives: computer graphics, visualization, game development, human-computer interaction.'

AssertionError: 'ALC-AS' not found in "AMST 2006 fulfills the Historical Analysis (HST-AS) distribution requirement. Since it's a lower-level course with a category of HST-AS, I would recommend taking it over any other option that also fulfills this requirement. This is because courses with lower course numbers are generally more entry-level and easier to fit into your schedule. By taking AMST 2006 first, you'll have fulfilled one of your distribution requirements while keeping your course load manageable."
