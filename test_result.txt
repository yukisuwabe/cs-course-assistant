AssertionError: 'CS 3410' not found in "Based on the inferred graduation requirements, I would recommend CS 4820 - Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms as the course that teaches about the architecture of computers. This course covers topics such as algorithm design techniques, undecidability and NP-completeness, and algorithmic techniques for intractable problems, which are related to computer architecture.\n\nAlternatively, you could also consider taking CS 4420 - Computer Architecture, but since it's not a required core course, I would recommend starting with CS 4820."
